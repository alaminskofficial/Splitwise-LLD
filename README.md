Features
Add User
Users can register and create accounts by providing their details. Each user has a unique identifier associated with their account.

Create Group

Manage Group Members
Group creators can manage group membership by adding or removing members. Members can view group expenses and contribute their share.

Record Expenses
Users can record expenses, specifying the amount, description, and who participated in the expense. Expenses are automatically divided equally among the participants.

View Balances
Users can view their balances within a group, showing how much they owe or are owed by other group members. This helps in tracking individual contributions and expenses.
